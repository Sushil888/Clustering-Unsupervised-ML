# Scaler : Unsupervised ML with Clustering Techniques
## Motivation:
Scaler, an online tech-versity, seeks to identify career paths most desired by its learners. This analysis helps guide curriculum development and career services for better student outcomes.

## Data & Objective:
Data includes learner profiles with their job titles, companies, and other relevant features. The objective is to group learners with similar career paths using unsupervised clustering techniques.

## Methodology:
Feature Engineering: Preprocessing and transforming data for effective clustering.
Manual Clustering: Initial exploration through manual data segmentation.
Unsupervised Clustering: K-means clustering: Identifying distinct clusters of learners based on their career features. Hierarchical clustering: Exploring potential sub-clusters within identified groups.
## Evaluation:
Cluster stability analysis to assess clustering quality. Interpreting cluster characteristics and identifying common career paths within each group.

## Outcome:
Scaler identified distinct career clusters with shared features like job roles, companies, and skills. This valuable insight helps tailor Scaler's offerings and guidance to specific student needs and aspirations.
